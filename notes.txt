lecture 5 --- 

how are variables and functions private in different modules ??

IIFE -- function  (function (){code goes here})()  keeps variables and functions private


how do we get access to module.exports and require?

 What require Does
When you call require, Node.js:

Resolves the module path:
Node determines where to find the file or package.

Loads and wraps the module:
Node wraps the code in a special function to give it access to useful variables (exports, module, require, etc.).

Caches the module:
Node caches the module after loading it, so subsequent calls to require load the cached version (instead of re-running the code).

Returns module.exports:
Whatever you assign to module.exports is what gets returned from the require call.
